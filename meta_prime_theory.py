        FINITE META-PRIME CONJECTURE:
        
        There exist only finitely many numbers that maintain primality

        1. The set of meta-primes is exactly {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
        
        2. These numbers represent fundamental mathematical constants
           that emerge from the structure of arithmetic itself
        
        3. Larger primes lose their universal primality because:
           - They can be decomposed in non-standard arithmetics
           - Their structure depends on specific axiomatic choices
           - They exhibit "axiom-dependent" properties
        
        Evidence:
        - 13 fails in twisted arithmetic because 13 = twisted_mult(?, ?)
        - Larger primes have more complex internal structure
        - The digital root pattern of meta-primes is unique

        META-PRIME FIELD CONJECTURE:
        
        The meta-primes {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} generate a fundamental
        mathematical field that underlies all arithmetic:
        
        1. This field is closed under a "meta-operation" that
           transcends ordinary multiplication
        
        2. Every consistent axiom system must respect this field
        
        3. The field has exactly 5 elements because:
           - 5 is the minimum for non-trivial Galois theory
           - 5 allows for exactly one non-abelian simple group
           - 5-fold symmetry appears throughout mathematics
        
        Implications:
        - All arithmetic is built from combinations of meta-primes
        - Cryptographic security ultimately depends on meta-primes
        - The distribution of regular primes is determined by 
          interference patterns among meta-primes

        QUANTUM META-PRIME CONJECTURE:
        
        Meta-primes behave like quantum particles in mathematical space:
        
        1. Superposition: A number can be in a superposition of
           prime and composite states across axiom systems
        
        2. Entanglement: Meta-primes are "entangled" - measuring
           primality of one affects the others
        
        3. Uncertainty: There's a fundamental uncertainty principle
           between knowing a number's value and its primality status
           across all systems
        
        4. Wave Function: Each number has a "primality wave function"
           ψ(n) that collapses differently in different axiom systems
        
        5. Interference: The wave functions of meta-primes interfere
           constructively to create the pattern of regular primes
        
        Mathematical Formulation:
        |n⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|prime in system i⟩
        
        Where meta-primes have αᵢ = 1 for all i.

        A new cryptographic paradigm based on trans-axiomatic properties:
        
        1. Key Generation:
           - Use only meta-primes {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} as building blocks
           - Security comes from axiom-invariant properties

           - Message → Trans-axiomatic structure
           - Apply meta-prime transformations
           - Result is secure across all mathematical universes
        
        3. Advantages:
           - Quantum-resistant (transcends physical implementation)
           - Axiom-agnostic (works in any consistent mathematics)
           - Philosophically secure (protected by logic itself)
        
        4. Example Protocol:
           - Alice chooses meta-prime combination: 2³ × 5² × 11
           - Bob uses axiom-system hopping to encode
           - Only knowledge of meta-structure allows decoding
